# Webpack ES2015 and Sass Boilerplate

A barebones webpack 4 config with webpack-dev-server, babel 7, eslint and prettier.

## Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

## Developing Locally
1. Run
```
npm run serve
```

This starts webpack dev server on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and webpack will watch for changes and automatically reload the browser.
